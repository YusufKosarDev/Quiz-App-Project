**Quiz App Project**

This is a simple and interactive Mini Quiz Application built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback based on their selections.

⚙️ How Does It Work?

The project is built using core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation and event handling:

HTML Structure: Defines the quiz layout, questions, options, and buttons

CSS Styling: Provides basic styling for layout, buttons, and responsive design

DOM Selection: JavaScript selects elements using querySelector

Event Listeners: User interactions (click events) are handled dynamically

Quiz Logic: Questions, answers, and score are managed using JavaScript arrays and variables
